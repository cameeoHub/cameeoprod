        <p>Hello and welcome to the Cameeo Productions website.
            <br>
            <b><color>A message from creator Jacob Kendall...</color></b>

            "You may find yourself here as somebody who is quite familiar with our work, or maybe you have been sent our way by a happy customer or a google search...
            <br>
            Either way, it's no skin off our nose to tell you what we here at <b><color>Cameeo Prod.</color></b> are all about.

            <b><color>Cameeo Productions</color></b> was created by myself only a year ago. The first idea behind the company, was to create <b><color>an open space for the enjoyment of human expression</color></b>. Beginning with the mediums of videography, spoken word and dance - I built a portfolio of expression and my online pressence as Cameeo. The initial motive behind the name being, to make an anonymous title to explore under. Coming from a very creative educational background, I found that it was very easy as a young creative in the days of social media, to surround yourself with an echo chamber. So I decided to begin my new creative process under a name I knew no-one close would recognise. I wanted to have an honest response. To see if my work got recognition on its very own merit - without the obviously much appreciated support of creative friends.
            <br>

            <br>
            My idea in the beginning was to have a space where I could explore my own practices - but also where others could find common place with my words or ideas. I never wanted to be too opinionated. The goal was never to have people listen to what I was saying and agree. It was important that people levelled with what was being said on an emotional level.
            <br>
            I wanted to speak to the heart. I began creating movement and dance content. The reason I started here is because I already had a foundation in video editing and had always wanted to explore my passion for movement as a form of expression. I saw this as the perfect springboard to find my confidence in editing again and also renew my ideas about expression.
            <br>
            During this journey and building my brand - for the first time, I started to get to grips with how to brand my content. Starting with logo editing, moving all the way through to website development. I attended courses and now knew the direction I wanted to head in with my work and career ambitions.
            <br>
            -
            <br>
